Parser & ParserOutput review

The implementation of the LL(1) parser is very well structured and defined by having functions respecting the single responsibility principle.
The naming of the variables and the functions are suggestive and intuitive, such as "getProductionByOrderNumber", "generateTree", "computeFirstSets" and so on.
The table print is organised, which makes it easy to read.
Unfortunately, the functions are not provided with comments for describing their behaviour.
