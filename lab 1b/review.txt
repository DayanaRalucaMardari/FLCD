Review on Lab 2 by Edi

Lexic:

- I like how the lexic is structured, it is easy to read and understand.
- The way you have used the lexic to explain the different parts of the code is perfect.
- The language is very clear and easy to understand.
- It is a very intuitive language.

Syntax:

- I like how you combine the syntax of different popular languages to create a new one.
- Everything is very well explained and easy to understand.
- The syntax is very intuitive and easy to follow.

Token:

- The tokens you provided are correct in terms of the language you have created.
- I like how you used "returns" instead of "return", maybe it should be like this in every language.
  I think it more sense to use 'returns' because a function "returns" something, it doesn't "return" something.
- I like that in your language, read is used to read any type of input, not just integers for example.

Overall:

The language created by Dayana is very clear and concise. It is very easy to understand and follow.
Dayana has done a great job in creating a new language that is easy to use and maintain.
